# Gregorian-Calendar-Error
Calculates the current error in the Gregorian Calendar

## Overview
The Gregorian Calendar was adopted on October 15, 1582.

The Gregorian Calendar has 365 days on non leap years and 366 on leap year.
A leap year happens every year that is divisible by 4 that is not except for years
that are divisible by 100 unless that year is divisible by 400.

This means that the average Gregorian Calendar year is 365.2425 days.

In contrast a tropical year is aproximately 365.24219 days or 365 solar days, 5hours, 
48 minutes, 45 seconds.

This means that the Gregorian Calendar increases its error by about 26 seconds per year.

## Error Calculations
This program assumes that on October 15, 1582, when the Gregorian Calendar was first adopted, there was no error.
In other words October 15, 1582 is exactly October 15, 1582.

### Far Past Error
Earths Rotation will not be taken into account because the error in estimating the error will be much greater than
the error caused by earths rotation at a given time.
